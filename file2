The error you're encountering happens because git merge expects a branch or commit reference, not a remote URL. When you run the command git merge https://github.com/Ganeshkumar45/Demo.git, Git tries to merge the URL itself, which is not a valid argument.

Hereâ€™s how you can merge a remote repository correctly:

Add the remote repository as a remote (if not already added):
bash
Copy
git remote add demo https://github.com/Ganeshkumar45/Demo.git
Fetch the data from the remote repository:
bash
Copy
git fetch demo
Merge the desired branch from the remote repository into your current branch:
For example, if you want to merge the main branch from the demo remote:

bash
Copy
git merge demo/main
